Paymant

             orderId
             ammount
             wayToPay  - visa , cash ect…….
Actions :
              To save the details of payment method .
               To make sure that order paid 

למחלקת תשלום יש שדה בשם OrderID
והוא נחשב כמפתח זר - כך שכאשר נוצרת הזמנה נוצר ביחד תשלום 
וorderId ביחד עם paymentId יוצרים קשר יחודי !
